## Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Ally Kiwindu. I am a passionate educator from Tanzania, currently exploring the world of artificial intelligence, software development, and technology innovation. I strongly believe in the power of learning and aim to use AI to solve real-world problems in education and healthcare. In my spare time, I enjoy working on projects that make a difference, collaborating with teams across Africa, and investing in self-development.
